		 <p> <em>Halley's Comet</em>, which is located in the Kuiper Belt, is perhaps the most famous comet in history. Halley's Comet passes
		  by the Earth every 75 years with the next estimated date for the comet to be seen from Earth is 2061. </p>

		<h3>Tell me more about comets!</h3> 
		
			<p>Comets are usually not visible to our eyes unless they are near the sun. When the comet gets close to the sun, 
			it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail
			 that stretches away from the sun for millions of kilometers. </p>  
	 		
	 		<p>Astronomers state that comets formed around 4.6 billion years ago when the solar system was born. They contain a mix of
	 		 frozen gases, rocks, ice and dust. Comets are sometimes called icy dirtballs. Because of their low mass, comets cannot
	 		  become round under their own gravity and will have irregular shapes. Comet nuclei are one of the darkest substances 
	 		  in the Universe they only reflect 4% of light. For a reference, asphalt reflects 7% of light. They orbit that sun 
	 		  in an elliptical pattern. There are short period comets, broken into the Jupiter family (less than 20 years) and the 
	 	  	Halley family (less than 200 years). There are also long- period orbits which are any comet that has an orbit lasting 
	 	  	longer than 200 years.</p>

			<li>The force of gravity can rip comets apart</li>
			<li>Comet nuclei can range from 100 meters to more than 40 kilometers</li>
			<li>Some long period comets have orbits that can last millions of years</li>
			<li>In ancient times, comets were known to be as sign of bad luck. In fact, 
			a Roman Emperor once ordered all of his successors to be executed because he saw a comet</li>
